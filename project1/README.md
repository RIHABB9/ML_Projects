# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 🎯 Objective  
Develop a machine learning model to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions in a **highly imbalanced dataset** using historical data.

## 📊 Dataset  
- Public credit card transaction dataset (anonymized features, binary fraud labels).  
- Fraud cases represent only **~0.17%** of all transactions.  

## 🔑 Key Steps  
- Data exploration with **Pandas**  
- Fraud-to-valid ratio analysis  
- Transaction amount distribution comparison (fraud vs. valid)  
- Feature correlation **heatmap** with **Seaborn**  
- Train/test split (**80% training, 20% testing**) for model preparation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## ✅ Outcome  
Established a clear pipeline for handling **imbalanced data** and preparing for **fraud detection models**.
